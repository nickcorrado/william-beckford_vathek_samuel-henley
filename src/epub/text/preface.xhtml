			<p>The original of the following
			story, with some others of a similar kind, collected in the east
			by a man of letters, was communicated to the editor above three
			years ago. The pleasure he received from the perusal of it
			induced him at that time to transcribe, and since to translate
			it. How far the copy may be a just representation it
			becomes not him to determine. He presumes however to hope
			that if the difficulty of accommodating our English idioms to the
			Arabic, preserving the correspondent tones of a diversified
			narration, and discriminating the nicer touches of character
			through the shades of foreign manners be duly
			considered, a failure in some points will not preclude him from
			all claim to indulgence; especially if those images, sentiments,
			and passions, which being independent of local peculiarities, may
			be expressed in every language, shall be found to retain their
			native energy in our own.</p>
